This Repo contains a sample of python code that I have done outside of work.  Mostly in relationship to Project Euler problems or the occasionally puzzle I stumble across on the internet.  There's not a lot of Object Oriented code here, mostly because the problems are usually straight forward enough to not require a large amount of data structures.

The SupportFunctions folder contains helper functions that I expand on when needed for the problems I am working on.  I only add new functions if I think they will be needed for future problems.

The C_Code is a dump of Project Euler problems that I had originally solved in C and wanted to be able to reference while developing my python code.  They are fairly self contained source files, but may require some massaging to build properly.
