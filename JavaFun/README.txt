This project has recently take a big change.  The existing java code in the FlowGUIClinet, FlowGameServer, and FlowMessages will be left alone for now.  I decided my application would be better served as a webapp.  So in my attempt to better understand Java Webservices I'm building this application using a different set of tools in J2EE.  Specificailly JSP, JQuery, and MySQL.  The HTMLServer will contain the majority of the code.  The model package within will be used in the future to make none webbased applications.
