The Flow Game is a Java application that consists of multiple projects.  There will be three core components.  The FlowGUIClient, FlowGameServer, and FlowMessages.  The FlowGUIClient will provide a GUI interface to talk to the FlowGameServer.  The FlowGameServer will track all connected users and AIs.  The FlowMessage is used by all projects and will also act as a library for those who want to build their own client.  There will eventually be a FlowAI that will act as a Client but be driven by the Server.  The goal is to have multiple plug and play AIs so that they can be quickly developed and used.  

There is an Excel spreadsheet called MessageLayout that defines the message interface.  There is also an EmbedmentManual that will describe individual fields.  The excel file exists because word is being uncooperative with table additions.
